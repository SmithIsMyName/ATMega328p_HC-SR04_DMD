# ATMega328p_HC-SR04_DMD
Author: Charles Minchau (SmiteMeSmith)
Program uses a ATMega328p MCU to query a HC-SR04 ultrasonic module to calculate and display the result in cm on the
NewHaven display. The ultrasonic module is triggered every 60 ms by setting pin PC4 (the trigger) high for 10 us. A
change in state on pin PC5 (the echo) causes a interrupt which checks if PC5 is high. If it is a timer is started
that increments every micro second. Once PC5 triggers a interrupt again and is low the result is calculated and
displayed in centimeters on the NewHaven display. Distance in cm is calculated by the amount of microseconds PC5 (the
echo) is high divided by 58.
